			<question>
				<keyword>change style sheet for editor</keyword>
				<answer> It is possible to configure what css-files the editor, as well as the XForm editor loads and uses. This can be configured in two ways.

   1. As a property on the page.
      This property can be either a dynamic or a standard page property. The property needs to be named UIEditorCssPaths and in the form of a comma separated list of paths to the stylesheets. Setting this in page or dynamic properties will override the correlating setting in Web.config.
   2. As a setting in Web.config.
      If no property is set the fallback will be to use the setting uiEditorCssPaths in web.config. This setting is also in the form of a comma separated list of paths to the stylesheets. The web.config setting will be used if no property on the page is set to point out alternative stylesheets.

Sample of a comma-separated css-path list:

"~/Templates/Public/Styles/Glossy/Editor.css, ~/Templates/Public/Styles/Glossy/Editor2.css". </answer>

			<question>
				<keyword>create a custom dropdown list</keyword>
				<answer> To create a custom DropDownList to be used in Edit Mode start with creating a Custom Property.

   1. Right-click the project root node and select Add -> New Item...
   2. Select the EPiServer Node
   3. Choose Custom Property and type a name for the property
   4. In the "Create Custom Property" dialog that follows, select Derived and choose Longstring as the parent type (also make sure that "Create an associated Control used for rendering the custom property" is checked)

At this point we have a control ready to be manipulated. Open the control source (if we named our property CustomProp, the control would be CustomPropControl.cs)

Add a DropDownList instance to your class. 

C#
System.Web.UI.WebControls.DropDownList _DropDown = new System.Web.UI.WebControls.DropDownList();

This instance will be used to manipulate your controls rendering and data.

To make this control be the one rendered, override the CreateEditControls method and add the DropDownList instance to the control set.

C#
public override void CreateEditControls()
{
    _DropDown.Items.Add("An item");
    this.ApplyControlAttributes(_DropDown);
    Controls.Add(_DropDown);
}</answer>
			</question>
			<question>
				<keyword>use data source controls</keyword>
				<answer> The controls shipped with the latest EPiServer release are built and designed with ease of use in mind. There should be very little need of adding your own code behind to these classes as they are intended to be used in markup rather than coded against or inherited from.

If you do need additional functionality we recommend that you inherit from the GenericDataSource control and create your own classes that suit your needs. </answer>
